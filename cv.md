## Who am I

I'm a journalist with 10 years' experience. I'm currently working for BBC Russian in Moscow. Two years ago I started coding and I realized that I liked it better. I started with R and Python. I parse and analyse data, I make charts with ggplot. I analyze satellite data and visualise it. For now, it's more like a hobby, and I'd like to pursue a career in web development. 

## Skills

1. **R** (dplyr, ggplot2, selenium)
2. **Python** (numpy, pandas, matplotlib)
3. **HTML/CSS/JS**

## Experience 

* Court cases parser, **R**. This script downloads court materials from the database of the Russian courts [github.com/asspirin12/courtcases_parser](https://github.com/asspirin12/courtcases_parser).

* Belarus elections analysis, **R**. Here I analyzed and visualised data collected by activists during presidential elections in Belarus in 2020. [github.com/asspirin12/bel-elections](https://github.com/asspirin12/bel-elections).

* Bankruptcy cases parser, **Python**. This script downloads bankruptcy notices from Fedresurs website. [github.com/asspirin12/bankruptcy](https://github.com/asspirin12/bankruptcy).

* Putin speeches analysis, **R, Python**. I parsed all news items from Kremlin.ru and archive.premier.gov.ru websites. Effectively I created a database of everything that Vladimir Putin said publicly. I split the sentences into single words and counted how many times he used different words. I can't publish the code, but the project is available here: [Как изменилась риторика Путина?

## English

I speak and write fluently and idiomatically. In recent years I read many books in English, technical literature, and non-fiction included. During my work, I report news in English on air when I'm asked to. I don't have a certificate to prove my English, but I can demonstrate my skills if need be.
